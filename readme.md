# Bouncing Ball Animation

   This is a simple web animation that simulates a bouncing ball within a canvas.

## How it Works

1. **Canvas Setup**: The animation is displayed on an HTML canvas element.

2. **Bouncing Ball Logic**: The ball moves horizontally across the canvas, bouncing off the left and right edges. When the ball hits the top or bottom edge, it reverses direction. The color of the ball changes upon each bounce.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - Clicking the canvas pauses or resumes the animation.
   - Clicking the "Reset Animation" button resets the ball position, direction, and color.

4. **Animation Speed**: The animation speed is based on the browser's requestAnimationFrame, and it can be affected by the user's interaction (pause/resume).
